# Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?

Back in 2014, [fivethiryeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/) published an article on alchohol consumption in different countries. The data `drinks` is available as part of the `fivethirtyeight` package. Make sure you have installed the `fivethirtyeight` package before proceeding.


```{r, load_alcohol_data}
library(fivethirtyeight)
data(drinks)
view(drinks)

# or download directly
# alcohol_direct <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/alcohol-consumption/drinks.csv")

```


What are the variable types? Any missing values we should worry about? 

```{r glimpse_skim_data}
  # glimpse() is part of the dplyr package
  # gives the first entries of each variable in a row, with data type within <>
  # int / dbl --> "integer" and "double"
glimpse(drinks)

  # skim() is part of the skimr package
  # computes common summary univariate statistics
skim(drinks)

 ## The variable types are therefore, CHARACTER and NUMERIC (int / dbl)
```


Make a plot that shows the top 25 beer consuming countries

```{r beer_plot}
# this creates a new data frame "beer_plot" and assigns to it the "beer_servings" column in descending order, and picks the top 25
beer_plot <- drinks %>% # use shift + cmd + M
  arrange(desc(beer_servings)) %>% 
  select(country, beer_servings) %>% 
  head(25) 

ggplot(beer_plot, aes(x= beer_servings, y = reorder(country, beer_servings))) +
  
  geom_col()+ #geom_col generates a barplot
  labs( #sets the labels for x and y axis
    title = "Top 25 beer consuming countries",
    x = "Servings",
    y = "Countries"
  )

```

Make a plot that shows the top 25 wine consuming countries

```{r wine_plot}
wine_plot <- drinks %>% 
  arrange(desc(wine_servings)) %>% 
  select(country, wine_servings) %>% 
  head(25)

ggplot(wine_plot, aes(x = wine_servings, y= reorder(country, wine_servings)))+
  
  geom_col()+
  labs(
    title = "Top 25 wine consuming countries",
    x = "Number of Servings",
    y = "Countries"
  )

# see above
```

Finally, make a plot that shows the top 25 spirit consuming countries
```{r spirit_plot}
spirit_plot <- drinks %>% 
  arrange(desc(spirit_servings)) %>% 
  select(country, spirit_servings) %>% 
  head(25)

ggplot(spirit_plot, aes(x = spirit_servings, y = reorder(country, spirit_servings)))+
  geom_col()+
  labs(
    title = "Top 25 Spirit Consuming Countries",
    x = "Number of Servings",
    y = "Countries"
  )
  
#see above
  
```

What can you infer from these plots? Don't just explain what's in the graph, but speculate or tell a short story (1-2 paragraphs max).
